[introduction]
= Introduction

This document describes the APIs for the Account module. A account is an organization or individual who might be interested
in buying the product sold by a company. 

[getting-started]
= Getting started

[getting-started-running-the-service]
== Running the service
Account APIs are written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/kdhrubo/hoogly.git
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd git/hoogly/account
$ ./gradlew build
$ java -jar build/libs/*.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/cheak-account-heartbeat/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/cheak-account-heartbeat/http-response.adoc[]

[getting-started-creating-a-account]
== Create a Account
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new account. To create a account you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI, including a JSON
payload containing the atleast the first name and last name of the account:

include::{snippets}/create-account/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and the saved payload:

[getting-started-find-accounts]
== Find Accounts
A set of accounts can be found by sending a `GET` request. This API is capable of handling search criteria, sorting and paging. For more details check the API guide. 

include::{snippets}/find-all-account/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a list of accounts if found in the data store. 

include::{snippets}/find-all-account/http-response.adoc[]


[getting-started-find-account]
== Find Unique Account
A account can be located in the data store by its primary key.

The `GET` request below is used to retrieve a account by its unique key.

include::{snippets}/find-one-account/curl-request.adoc[]

The account is retrieved and then returned from the datastore as shown in the response below.

include::{snippets}/find-one-account/http-response.adoc[]


== Delete Account

A account can be deleted by sending a `DELETE` request. The record is not removed from the data store, instead the status is changed. In other words, this is only a
soft delete. The resulting data in the recyle bin can be retried with find accounts API (above) with search criteria set to 'deleted:true' 

include::{snippets}/delete-one-account/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a list of accounts if found in the data store. 

include::{snippets}/delete-one-account/http-response.adoc[]


== Purge Account

A account can be purged by sending a `DELETE` request with purge request parameter set to true. The record is removed from the data store. In other words, this is a hard delete. 

include::{snippets}/purge-account/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a list of accounts if found in the data store. 

include::{snippets}/purge-account/http-response.adoc[]

== Restore Account

A account can be restored by sending a `PUT` request with restore request with the account id. The soft deleted record is restored and is available again in find all request. 

include::{snippets}/restore-account/curl-request.adoc[]

This will return a list of accounts if found in the data store. 

include::{snippets}/restore-account/http-response.adoc[]
